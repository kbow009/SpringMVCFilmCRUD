### Lessons Learned
This app was difficult due to the amount of interconnected technologies and files. Additionally, it was our first attempt at working through GIT with a partner, which presented numerous difficulties. Communication and teamwork were PARAMOUNT to our ability to get work done, and this project made it clear that working with (a) partner(s) will continue to be a primary consideration into the future.
